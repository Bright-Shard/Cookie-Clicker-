# Cookie Clicker++
Free, open source cookie clicker hacks. Because cookie.

# Installing
Install a userscript manager, such as [Tamper Monkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net), and then [download the script](https://github.com/Bright-Shard/Cookie-Clicker-PlusPlus/raw/master/CookieClicker%2B%2B.user.js). Your userscript manager should automatically import the script - if it doesn't, simply save the file, open your userscript manager, and import it manually from there.

# Using
Currently, Cookie Clicker++ runs in the JavaScript console (I'll probably add a UI later). Go to right click > inspect > Console or hit F12 to open the console, and the plugin will print out the commands you can use from there.
